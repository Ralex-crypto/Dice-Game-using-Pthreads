How to compile and run the Project 2 code on zeus.cs.txtstate.edu:

COMPILE:
	gcc -pthread main.c -o main

RUN:
	./main [seed]

A log file will be created called log.txt which contains the output of the program. The contents of log.txt will be overwritten if it already exists.

There are 5 pre-existing log files which show the output of the program with different seeds:
log1.txt uses seed 12345678
log2.txt uses seed 123456789
log3.txt uses seed 1234567
log4.txt uses seed 123456
log5.txt uses seed 1234567890
